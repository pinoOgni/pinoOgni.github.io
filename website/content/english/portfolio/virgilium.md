[Virgilium Editor](https://github.com/pinoOgni/VirgiliumEditor) is the project of the System and Device Programming course of the year 2018/2019 from the Polytechnic of Turin. In short, a real-time text editor based on the CRDT algorithm, developed using Qt(5.12.3).


#### My work in brief

In this project I took care of both the frontend and the backend part using Qt. In the frontend I have implemented the login screens and the user's personal page with all the management and viewing of files. In the backend I have implemented the part relating to user access, to save files with all related queries (using sqlite3).
