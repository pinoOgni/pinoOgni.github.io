[VirtualLabs](https://github.com/pinoOgni/VirtualLabsFE) is the project of the Internet Applications course of the academic year 2019/2020 of the Polytechnic of Turin.

VirtualLabs is a web application that is used to help teachers and students manage virtual laboratories. 

#### My work in brief

In this project I took care of the frontend part using Angular in particular:
* team management by a student (creation, acceptance / rejection of a request, viewing of requests)
* management of an assignment by a professor (creation, review, grade, historical view)
* management of an assignment by a student (version delivery, visualization and more)
