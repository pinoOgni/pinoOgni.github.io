    - name : "Creating Disaggregated Network Services with eBPF: the Kubernetes Network Provider Use Case"
      authors : "[Federico Parola](https://it.linkedin.com/in/federico-parola-5b496b200), [Leonardo Di Giovanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-di-giovanna-1a5453107/), Giuseppe Ognibene, [Fulvio Risso](https://fulvio.frisso.net/)"
      collection : "2022 IEEE 8th International Conference on Network Softwarization (NetSoft)"
      organization: "IEEE"
      abstract : "eBPF enables the creation of custom and highly efficient network services. The most prominent examples of such services follow a monolithic approach: this makes the code hard to maintain, to extend and difficult to reuse. This paper leverages the Polycube framework to demonstrate that a disaggregated approach is feasible also with eBPF: it considers a complex network scenario, such as a complete Kubernetes network provider, presenting the resulting architecture and a preliminary perf. evaluation"
    - name : "Enabling Scalable SFCs in Kubernetes with eBPF-based Cross-Connections"
      authors : "[Federico Parola](https://it.linkedin.com/in/federico-parola-5b496b200), [Francesco Monaco](https://www.linkedin.com/in/francesco-monaco-85737b247/), Giuseppe Ognibene, [Fulvio Risso](https://fulvio.frisso.net/)"
      collection : "2022 IEEE Conference on Network Function Virtualization and Software Defined Networks (NFV-SDN)"
      organization: "IEEE"
      abstract : "Service Function Chains (SFCs) are ordered sets of Network Functions (NFs) that provide network services. Telco operators require scalable chains to adapt to fluctuating traffic. While Kubernetes enhances scalability and flexibility for general-purpose applications, it lacks features needed for network services. This paper presents a cloud-native architecture integrating SFCs in Kubernetes, enabling horizontal autoscaling. The solution uses flexible cross-connections to adapt network traffic distribution, validated with an open-source implementation using Kubernetes operators and an eBPF load balancer."

      collection : "IEEE Access ( Volume: 11)"
      organization: "IEEE"
      abstract : "Cloud-native networks leverage Kubernetes (K8s) and eBPF technology to revolutionize networking, security, and observability. This paper introduces eBPF's potential for Telco cloud and explores innovative pricing models tied to eBPF agents and modules. We present our eBPF platform, Sauron, demonstrating its ability to dynamically load custom code for energy estimation, network monitoring, and real-time security. Experimental results showcase eBPF's efficacy in enhancing performance, observability, and security across current and future mobile networks (5G, 6G)."
