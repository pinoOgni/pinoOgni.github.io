      authors : "[Federico Parola](https://it.linkedin.com/in/federico-parola-5b496b200), [Leonardo Di Giovanna](https://www.linkedin.com/in/leonardo-di-giovanna-1a5453107/), Giuseppe Ognibene, [Fulvio Risso](https://fulvio.frisso.net/)"

      organization: "IEEE"
      abstract : "eBPF enables the creation of custom and highly efficient network services. The most prominent examples of such services follow a monolithic approach: this makes the code hard to maintain, to extend and difficult to reuse. This paper leverages the Polycube framework to demonstrate that a disaggregated approach is feasible also with eBPF: it considers a complex network scenario, such as a complete Kubernetes network provider, presenting the resulting architecture and a preliminary perf. evaluation"

Hi, I'm Giuseppe (for friends, Pino), a Computer Engineer. I am passionate about the world of computer science, technology in general and Open Source. I like to work in team and learn new ways to solve problems that may arise in front of an engineer ðŸ¤¯. Resistant to stress, especially thanks to the PoliTo.

* MSc in Computer Engineering (Network Computers) at Polytechnic of Turin [104/110], 04/2021
* BSc in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic of Turin [96/110], 07/2018
