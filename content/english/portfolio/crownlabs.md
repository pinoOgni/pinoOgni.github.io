[CrownLabs](https://github.com/netgroup-polito/CrownLabs) is a set of services designed to deliver remote computing labs through per-user environments, based either on virtual machines or lightweight containers.

This service was set up in about three weeks by a group of students enrolled in the MSc of Computer Engineering at Polytechnic of Turin (Italy), under the pressure of the Coronavirus, in March 2020.

CrownLabs is currently developed, maintained and operated by a group of volunteers, mainly MSc students in Computer Engineering at Polytechnic of Turin, Italy.


#### My work in brief

In this project I worked on the backend part, in particular on the monitoring (Kube-Prometheus, Blackbox Exporter) and if necessary I also switched to the frontend (a little bit), working together with my team mates on the CrownLabs website and on the personal page of a student/professor.
